I’ll take up his challenge and derive an explicit formula for the likelihood function, enabling a Bayesian analysis without the need for sampling methods.\nI’ll also propose an alternative model to take into account my personal further belief that the Tweet was made after the 11th sock, knowing that the twelfth sock was going to break the run of distinct socks!\nAssumptions\nThis post makes some assumptions about you: that you’re interested in, and have some experience with, statistics and discrete probability.\nI’ll assume that you’re familiar twith the concepts of Bayesian statistics: a model (the likelihood) describes our understanding of how some data is generated, it can be combined with initial assumptions about plausible parameter values (prior distributions) and combining these with observed data leads to refined assumptions(posterior distributions).\nTo follow the derivation of the likelihood you’ll need to know some common constructs from discrete probability/combinatorics: e.g. understanding of binomial coefficients, and how these relate to counting problems.\nBååth’s Model\nOur aim is to estimate the total number of socks that Karl Broman washed on the 17th October 2014, given that he tweeted that the first 11 he removed from the washing machine were distinct.\nI’ll use the following notation throughout:\n\nI use the convention that data is denoted by letters from the Roman alphabet, whilst unknown parameters use the Greek alphabet.\n\\[\n\\begin{align*} \\bf{\\text{Data}}\\\\\nd & = \\text{No. successive distinct socks observed before Tweeting}\\\\\n\\\\\n\\bf{\\text{Parameters}}\\\\\n\\rho & = \\text{No. pairs of socks in the wash}\\\\\n\\sigma & = \\text{No. singleton socks in the wash} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nFor the specific case of the Tweet we have \\(d = 11\\).\nUsing two parameters \\(\\rho\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) allows us to handle the scenario that whilst most socks come in pairs, in some households stray singleton socks are not uncommon. We do however assume socks don’t come in multiples of more than two (excluding the not-uncommon scenario in which two pairs of identical socks are washed).\nThe likelihood, \\(L(d|\\rho,\\sigma)\\), describes how the unknown parameters generate the obsered data: Assuming there were \\(\\rho\\) pairs of socks and \\(\\sigma\\) singletons how likely is it that the first \\(d\\) socks are all distinct?\nAs a warm up for deriving a complete formula, let’s consider some of the edge cases which have fun logical heuristics:\nScenario\nHeuristic\nLikelihood \\(L(d|\\rho,\\sigma)\\)\n\\(\\rho, \\, \\sigma < 0\\)\nLet’s not be silly: you can’t have negative socks.\n0\n\\(d > 2\\rho + \\sigma\\)\nBroman can’t have observed more socks than he washed.\n0\n\\(d > \\rho + \\sigma\\)\nBroman can’t have observed more distinct socks than the number of distinct socks that he washed.\n0\nWith the edge cases handled, let’s press on and handle the meatier problem.\n\n\nLikelihood \\[\nL(\\rho,\\sigma|d) = \n\\binom{2\\rho + \\sigma}{d}^{-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{\\sigma} 2^{d-j} \\binom{\\sigma}{j} \\binom{\\rho}{d-j}\n\\]\n\n\nExamples \\[\nL(\\rho,\\sigma|d) = \n\\binom{2\\rho + \\sigma}{d}^{-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{\\sigma} 2^{d-j} \\binom{\\sigma}{j} \\binom{\\rho}{d-j}\n\\]\nAs a soft check that the formula above is correct, let’s take a look at some specific cases.\nExample: \\(\\bf{\\rho = 1, \\, \\sigma = 1, \\,d = 2}\\).\nThis is the smallest non-trial scenario, and we can check this easily by hand. If we denote the socks by {S,P1,P2}, there are three ways to choose two of them: {S,P1}, {S,P2} and {P1,P2}. In two of the scenarios the socks are distinct, so the likelihood is 2/3.\nPlugging the parameters/data into the formula above: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nL(2,1|2) & =   \\binom{3}{2}^{-1} \\left\\{ 2^2 \\binom{1}{0}\\binom{1}{2} + 2^1 \\binom{1}{1}\\binom{1}{1}\\right\\} = 3^{-1}\\left(0 + 2\\right)  = \\frac23\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nExample: \\(\\bf{\\rho=3,\\,\\sigma=4, \\, d = 4}\\)\nWhilst this example doesn’t sound much more complex, crunching numbers directly would be pretty tedious (admittedly, tricky) as the denominator of the likelihood formula suggests there are 210 scenarios to check.\nEvaluating the formula for these parameters indicates the likelihood is 129/210 ~ 0.614.\nWe can quickly validate this by simulating drawing four socks from 3 pairs and 4 singletons, and calculating the proportion of the draws that produced distinct socks.\n\n\nset.seed(1414214)\n\nrho <- 3\nsigma <- 4\nd <- 4\n\n# vector of all the socks\nall_socks <- c(rep(paste0(\"P\",1:rho), 2), paste0(\"S\", 1:sigma))\n\n# a function to sample d socks without replacement from all_socks, and return\n# 1 if all socks are distinct, and 0 otherwise\nsample_socks <- function(all_socks, d){\n  sock_sample <- sample(x = all_socks, size = d, replace = FALSE)\n  return( 1 * (length(sock_sample) == length(unique(sock_sample))) )\n}\n\n# draw samples \ndraws <- tibble(draw = map_dbl(1:1e05, ~sample_socks(all_socks, d)))\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nNo. Draws\n100,000\nNo. All Distinct\n61,360\nProb. All Distinct\n0.614\n\n\n\nProof\n\\[\nL(\\rho,\\sigma|d) = \n\\binom{2\\rho + \\sigma}{d}^{-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{\\sigma} 2^{d-j} \\binom{\\sigma}{j} \\binom{\\rho}{d-j}\n\\]\nIn words, the likelihood is given by the following fraction\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{No. ways to choose d }{\\bf{distinct}}\\text{ socks from $\\rho$ pairs and $\\sigma$ singletons.}}{\\text{No. ways to choose d socks from  $\\rho$ pairs and $\\sigma$ singletons.}} \n\\]\nStarting with the denominator, this is none other than the total number of ways to choose \\(d\\) objects without replacement from a total of \\(2 \\rho + \\sigma\\) (the factor of two is because \\(\\rho\\) pairs of socks equates to \\(2 \\rho\\) individual socks). That is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{2\\rho + \\sigma}{d}\\), and explains the leading term in the likelihood formula above.\nTurning to the numerator, I’ll break this down by conditioning on the number of singleton socks. I.e. we’ll count\n\\[\\text{No. of ways to choose $d$ distinct socks, given that $j$ of them are singletons.}\\]\nStarting with the sigletons, there are \\(\\binom{\\sigma}{j}\\) ways to choose exactly \\(j\\) of these. The remaining \\(d-j\\) socks need to come from the pairs, there are \\(\\rho\\) distinct socks that form \\(2\\rho\\) pairs, so there are \\(\\binom{\\rho}{d-j}\\) ways to choose the type of socks. But then for each of these \\(d-j\\) socks we need an additional factor of 2 as we could have chosen between two (left, and right?) socks. Bringing this together, we have:\n\\[2^{d-j}\\binom{\\rho}{d-j}\\binom{\\sigma}{j}.\\]\nThe full formula for numerator, and then the likelihood, follows by summing over the possible values of \\(j = 0,\\ldots,\\sigma\\).\nFor a similar proof, I previously posted an answer to a question on Cross Validated with a slightly different sock related problem.\n\n\nVisualising the Likelihood, and Computational Considerations\nWe’ve done the hard work to derive and validate the likelihood, and an immediate question is What does that function actually look like?.\nOne challenge we face when trying to evaluate the formula above is that the number of combinations quickly becomes very large - and that puts us at risk of integer overflow.\nTake for example the case \\(\\rho = 20,\\,\\sigma=10,\\,d=11\\), which is not an implausible scenario Using R to calculate just the denominator returns a figure of 37,353,738,800 - which is well in excess of the maximum integer R can work with.\n\nYou can check R’s max integer with: .Machine$integer.max which at time of writing returns 2,147,483,647\nOkay - my conscience (and awareness that this is googleable) forces me to be honest: we can get around this particular integer overflow risk by using R’s as.double() to cast integers to double precision numbers which can handle values up to \\(2 \\times 10^{308}\\). And now that I’m coming clean, R’s built in binomial functions already does this conversion for us…\nBut its still good practice to think through these types of computational risks, and actively avoid them. We’ll make use of two computational tricks to avoid any risk of falling foul of overflow problems.\nThe first trick will likely be familiar if you learnt maths or computer science since the early 17th Century: logarithms turn unfathomably large multiplications into reasonable summations. So rather than working with the likelihood, we’ll use the log-likelihood:\n\\[l(d|\\rho,\\,\\sigma) = \\log L(d|\\rho,\\,\\sigma).\\] Working on the log scale plays nicely with Bayesian statistics, changing Bayes rule from: the posterior is proportional to the prior times the likelihood, to the alternative, but admittedly not so memorable the log-posterior is equal to the log-prior plus the log-likelihood, plus a constant.\nLogarithms are great as they turn multiplication into addition - but when we write down the log-likelihood, the issue we now face is that there’s addition inside the logarithm:\n\\[l(d|\\rho,\\sigma) = -\\log \\textstyle{\\binom{2\\rho + \\sigma}{d}} + \\log \\bigg(\\textstyle \\sum_{j=0}^{\\sigma} 2^{d-j} \\binom{\\sigma}{j} \\binom{\\rho}{d-j}\\bigg)\\]\nIf we naively go ahead and calculate that sum and then take logs - then we won’t avoid the risk of overflow at all: we’d still calculate a sum of large integers, and then taking the logarithm is an after thought.\nWhat we really want to do is take the logarithm of the terms inside the summation - which will return values well within R’s comfort zone. So more generally, we want to turn a computation of the form \\(\\log \\left( x_1 + \\cdots + x_n\\right)\\) into a calculation in \\(\\log(x_1),\\ldots, \\log(x_n)\\).\nThis is where trick number two comes in: the log-sum-exp trick.\n\n\nLog-Sum-Exp Trick Given \\(x_1,\\ldots,x_n > 0\\), let \\(l_k = \\log(x_k)\\) and \\(l^* = \\max_k l_k\\). Then\n\\[\n\\log(x_1 + \\cdots +  x_n) =  l^* + \\log \\bigg ( \\exp(l_1 - l^*) + \\cdots + \\exp(l_n - l^*)\\bigg)\n\\]\n\n\nExample Given \\(x_1,\\ldots,x_n > 0\\), let \\(l_k = \\log(x_k)\\) and \\(l^* = \\max_k l_k\\). Then\n\\[\n\\log(x_1 + \\cdots +  x_n) =  l^* + \\log \\bigg ( \\exp(l_1 - l^*) + \\cdots + \\exp(l_n - l^*)\\bigg)\n\\]\nLet’s apply the trick in the context of calculating the log-likelihood \\(l(d = 11 | \\sigma = 2, \\rho = 30 )\\), which is\n\\[\nl(11 | 2,30) = -\\log \\textstyle  \\binom{62}{11} + \\log \\bigg(2^{11} \\binom{2}{0}\\binom{30}{11} + 2^{10} \\binom{2}{1}\\binom{30}{10} + 2^{9} \\binom{2}{2}\\binom{30}{9} \\bigg).\n\\]\nIf we do this by brute force, using R to evaluate each of the powers, and binomial coefficients this becomes:\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n l(11|2,30) & = -\\log 508271323092 \\\\\n & \\qquad + \\log \\big ( \n  111876710400 + 61532190720 + 7325260800\n \\big) \\\\\n & = - 26.95 + 25.92 \\\\\n & = -1.034\n\\end{align}\\]\nAnd back on the natural scale, that implies a likelihood of \\(L(11 |2,30) \\approx 0.36\\).\nThe bit that feels uncomfortable there is the sum of all those +10 digit numbers - and in real cases we could be summing more terms - each with more digits. So now let’s see how that looks using the log-sum-exp trick.\nAs per the statement above, we’ll first calculate the log of each of the terms (and include the denominator term, denoted \\(A\\) here, which we’ll need for the full calculation):\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\textstyle \\log \\binom{62}{11} & = A  \\approx 26.9543 \\\\\n\\textstyle \\log 2^{11} \\binom{2}{0}\\binom{30}{11} &= l_1 \\approx 25.4407 \\\\\n\\textstyle \\log  2^{10} \\binom{2}{1}\\binom{30}{10} &= l_2 \\approx 24.8428 \\\\\n\\textstyle \\log 2^{9} \\binom{2}{2}\\binom{30}{9} &= l_3 \\approx 22.7146 \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\] The maximum is \\(l^* = l_1\\), and we can go ahead and apply the trick: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nl(11|2,30) & = - A + l^* + \\log \\big ( e^{l_1 - l^*} + e^{l_2 - l^*} + e^{l_3 - l^*}\\big) \\\\\n& = -1.514 + \\log \\big( e^{0} + e^{-0.5978} + e^{-2.726} \\big) \\\\\n& = -1.514 + \\log \\big( 1+ {0.55} + {0.06548} \\big) \\\\\n& = -1.514 + 0.4796 \\\\\n& =  -1.034\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAs expected we get exactly the same result - with the benefit that the largest value we used in any of the sums was \\(A \\approx 26.95\\).\n\n\nProof Given \\(x_1,\\ldots,x_n > 0\\), let \\(l_k = \\log(x_k)\\) and \\(l^* = \\max_k l_k\\). Then\n\\[\n\\log(x_1 + \\cdots +  x_n) =  l^* + \\log \\bigg ( \\exp(l_1 - l^*) + \\cdots + \\exp(l_n - l^*)\\bigg)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosterior Parameter Estimation\nWe’ve done the hard work to derive and validate the likelihood, and now can reap the benefits: in this section I’ll choose a prior distribution, and combine with the likelihood to get our posterior distribution on the number of socks Karl Broman washed. Along the way I’ll talk through some subtleties you can employ to avoid numerical instability when calculating small probabilities.\n\nBååth’s blog post is a great starting point to learn more, but in short: Unlike standard Bayesian approaches, ABC doesn’t require you to write a formula for the likelihood of your model. Instead you describe a sampling procedure that matches the intended distribution. Combining this with samples from a prior distribution enables an acceptance/rejection algorithm which generates samples from the posterior distribution.↩\n",
